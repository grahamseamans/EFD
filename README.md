# ML Project.

- Graham Seamans

# Setup

- requires tensorflow, numpy, and matplotlib
- The video_matrix_tf.npy goes in `./`

# Running

- `python shapshot_tester.py` should do the trick
- in `snapshot_tester.py` there's calls to the different algorithms. you need to uncomment them to try it out unless you want to test the cDMD, in which case you will need to uncomment lines 35 - 37 and comment lines 31 - 32
